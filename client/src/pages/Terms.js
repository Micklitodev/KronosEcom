          We pride ourselves on keeping electronic cigarettes and all vapor
          related products out of the hands of minors. Per the new Texas law SB
          97, all online purchasers must verify their age with a third party
          verification software. To make this easier on our customers, we have
          included this in our check out process. You will be asked for your
          driver's license/ID information as well as the last four digits of
          your social security number. This information must be processed
          through the required database and saved in your customer account. You
          will only have to complete this process once under your personal
          account. We appreciate your cooperation and assistance in keeping
          devices and accessories out of the hands of minors.

          of the Services, or to any products or services sold or marketed by us
          or through the site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather
          than in court, in Clark County, Nevada, administered by JAMS pursuant
          to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The Federal
          Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
        </p>{" "}
        <br />
        <p>
          There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
          arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
          individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including
          injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must
          follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.

        <p>
          We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
          conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
          consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim
          proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right
          to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in
          court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property
          rights.
